# 🧠 My AI-Powered Portfolio Website

> Built with: a basic idea on frontedend, caffeine, and conversations with AI that went like:
>  
> **Me:** “Make it modern, animated, dark-themed, and responsive.”  
> **AI:** “Say no more.”  
>  
> And boom — a portfolio was born ✨

(Best viewed with dark mode on, but hey — light mode works now too. Thanks AI.)

## 💡 What’s This?

This is not your usual “handcrafted with 237 hours of HTML and tears” portfolio.  
Nope. I built this with **AI at my side** — because why reinvent buttons and navbars when AI does it better in milliseconds?

---

## 🤖 How AI Helped Me:

- 🧱 Generated the entire structure: hero section, navbar, animations — done.
- 🌙 Dark/Light themes? I just said “make it pretty” and AI pulled out a color palette.
- 🎯 Fixed responsiveness issues that I didn’t even *know* were issues yet.
- ⚙️ Animated scroll effects like I had a design degree (I don’t).
- 🔗 Told it: “Make my email clickable.” AI: “Say less.”
- 🧠 In short: I gave vibes. AI gave code.
